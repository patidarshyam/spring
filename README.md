# Doctor-Appoinment-Spring-App

This application I am creating to make you understand the end to end application. Here I will be providing the code snippet that will help you to get the actual code for spring application.

There I am following few steps that will help you to start application with proper way.
```
The proposed project is a smart appointment booking system that provides patients or any user an easy way of 
booking a doctor’s appointment online. This is a web based application that overcomes the issue of managing and 
booking appointments according to user’s choice or demands. The task sometimes becomes very tedious for the 
compounder or doctor himself in manually allotting appointments for the users as per their availability. 
Hence this project offers an effective solution where users can view various booking slots available and 
select the preferred date and time. The already booked space will be marked yellow and will not be available 
for anyone else for the specified time. This system also allows users to cancel their booking anytime. 
The application uses Jsp, Spring as a front-end and MySQL database as the back-end.

I will be creating separate files and name these files as [step_#No]
